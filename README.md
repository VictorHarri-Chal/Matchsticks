<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This project is based on a very famous game based on matchsticks.
There is a certain number of matchstick lines.
The two players take turns; each player can, on a same line, take one or several matchsticks.
The losing player is the one to take the last matchstick.

However, in this case, your playing against an AI who plays randomly !
